Are you stuck? Common Advent of Code Concepts
=============================================

If everything else fails, these great posts on reddit ([post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1gdw4cj/450_stars_a_categorization_and_megaguide/), [post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1hgegw6/what_concepts_are_generally_required_to_be_able/)) have a link of concepts that are appearing often in AoC problems - perhaps you need to apply one of them. I know I have a dynamic programming weak spot.

 - [Breadth First Search (BFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search), [Depth First Search (DFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
 - [Binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search)
 - [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
 - [Topological sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting)
 - [Dynamic Programming with memoisation or tabularisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming)
 - [Shoelace formula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula)
 - [Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor), [Least Common Multiple (LCM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple#Using_the_greatest_common_divisor) and [Modular Inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse)
 - [Linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra), [Spectral decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix)
 - [Chinese Reminder Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem)
 - [Interval arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic)
 - [Bitwise operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation)
 - [Priority queues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue)
 - [Parsing algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing), [Regular Expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)

Of these, I am missing at least the Shoelace formula in my lib, probably could do some functional programming to cover other topics (Binary search, BFS, DFS..).
